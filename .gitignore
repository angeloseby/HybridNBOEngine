# A comprehensive .gitignore for RStudio Projects
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# RStudio files
# These are user-specific files that store your session state,
# open tabs, etc. They should not be shared.
.Rproj.user/
.Ruserdata/

# R history files
# These save your command line history, which is not needed
# for reproducibility and might contain sensitive info.
.Rhistory
.Rapp.history

# R session data
# These files save your entire workspace environment.
# It's better to recreate the environment from scripts.
.RData
.RDataTmp

# R environment variables
# This file often contains secret keys, passwords, and API tokens.
# NEVER commit this file.
.Renviron

# Output files
# Any file generated by your scripts. It's better to
# track the script that *creates* these files.
# *.html
# *.pdf
# *.png
# *.jpg
# *.gif
# *.csv
# *.rds
# *.Rds
# *.rda
# *.Rda

# Exclude specific folders (add your own)
# Folders for raw data, large files, or temporary outputs.
# Good practice is to keep scripts and data separate.
# data/
# output/
# figures/
# temp/

# R Markdown / Knitr / Quarto
# Cache files and intermediate files.
*_cache/
*.utf8.md
